This project is in response of various diseases outbreak in various parts of the world. The project attempts to use the "social" data out there to 
capture the information from healthcare professionals (nurse/doctors etc.)
at the source.
  
 This attempts to use the following technologies

 a) Smart Phones which are universally available.
 b) Use openid (to identify the health care professional)
 c) Geolocation of the incidence and time/date


  This is just a part of solution - giving an API for the capture.
  There must be a phone app. which allows the professionals to record the incidence.
  Governement agencies will be able to use a "Real Time Heat map" to determine when thier resources needs to be targeted and there by making an impact on the over all spread of the disease.
